  <h3>HI THERE!</h3>
  <p>Welcome to my <strong>MDEF Diary</strong>, a personal space where I share my journey, my changes, reflections, and everything I’m learning along the way.
This diary will be constantly updated: a living space that evolves with me. </p>
  <p>.Through these pages, I’ll try to let you step into my mind, to share my vision and the way I see and interpret the world around me.</p>
  <p>.I hope that exploring it will help you understand my process, my choices.</p>
