> **Hi there!**  
> Welcome to my **MDEF Diary**, a personal space where I share my journey, my changes, reflections, and everything I’m learning along the way.  
> This diary will be constantly updated: a living space that evolves with me.  
> Through these pages, I’ll try to let you step into my mind, to share my vision and the way I see and interpret the world around me.  
> I hope that exploring it will help you understand my process, my choices.
