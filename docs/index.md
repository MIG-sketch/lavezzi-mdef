## Hi there!

Welcome to my MDEF Diary, a personal space where I share my journey, my changes, reflections, and everything I’m learning along the way.
This diary will be constantly updated: a living space that evolves with me.
Through these pages, I’ll try to let you step into my mind, to share my vision and the way I see and interpret the world around me.
I hope that exploring it will help you understand my process, my choices.
