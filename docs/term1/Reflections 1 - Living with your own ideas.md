# Prototypes to “become the best version of yourself”

The Thyroid Pill bracelet Prosthesis lets me become my daily cure, a wearable reminder that transforms necessity into expression.
I turned my thyroid pills into a bracelet, so the act of taking care of myself becomes visible, beautiful, and part of my identity.
By wearing what usually stays hidden in a drawer, I turn medication into decoration, treatment into culture.
It’s a way of reclaiming control, fragility into fashion.

The Thyroid Pill Grillz Prosthesis turns a symbol of style and showmanship into something personal and vital.
Instead of precious gems, I placed my thyroid pills, what is luxury for others becomes necessity turned into strength for me.
It’s a way to make something purely aesthetic become useful, and to give value to what is usually seen as fragility.
With these grillz, I can always carry my cure and style with me.

# Prototypes to “become something else”

The “Become Italian” Prosthesis lets others become me.
Many people don’t know how to twirl pasta with a fork, and this prototype makes it possible.
The fork spins on itself, gathering the spaghetti for the perfect bite, teaching the gesture with precision and style.
It’s a way to turn a cultural skill into a prosthesis: not just eating, but learning to do it like a true Italian.

# Prototypes to “judge and be judged” 

As a detective

12:18 p.m.  — we all go up to the terrace including the subject

12:20 p.m. — The subject is no longer on the terrace; I’ve lost her.

12:25 p.m. — I found her again; she’s petting a little dog.

12:30 p.m. — She’s kicking the little dog.

12:33 p.m. — The dog is dead.

12:40 p.m. — She’s trying to hide the body.
She threw it into the plastic recycling bin — it should’ve gone in the organic waste, btw.

12:42 p.m. — She’s selling cocaine to a pregnant woman.

12:52 p.m. — She met up with her classmates at a bar, pretending nothing happened, but I know what she did.

12:53 p.m. — She’s sipping a coffee paid for with drug money.

1:00 p.m. — She’s back in class. Just another normal day for Erandi.
