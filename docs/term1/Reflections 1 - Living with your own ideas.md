# Prototypes to “become something else”

The Thyroid Pill Prosthesis lets me become my daily cure, a wearable reminder that transforms necessity into expression.
I turned my thyroid pills into a bracelet, so the act of taking care of myself becomes visible, beautiful, and part of my identity.
By wearing what usually stays hidden in a drawer, I turn medication into decoration, treatment into culture.
It’s a way of reclaiming control, fragility into fashion.
