# Prototypes to “become the best version of yourself”

The Thyroid Pill bracelet Prosthesis lets me become my daily cure, a wearable reminder that transforms necessity into expression.
I turned my thyroid pills into a bracelet, so the act of taking care of myself becomes visible, beautiful, and part of my identity.
By wearing what usually stays hidden in a drawer, I turn medication into decoration, treatment into culture.
It’s a way of reclaiming control, fragility into fashion.

The Thyroid Pill Grillz Prosthesis turns a symbol of style and showmanship into something personal and vital.
Instead of precious gems, I placed my thyroid pills, what is luxury for others becomes necessity turned into strength for me.
It’s a way to make something purely aesthetic become useful, and to give value to what is usually seen as fragility.
With these grillz, I can always carry my cure and style with me.
