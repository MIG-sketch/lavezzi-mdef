# UNPACKING TECH SYSTEMS - FIRST WEEK

During the first week, we selected some electronic devices to dismantle with the idea of giving them a new life. We chose an HP LED monitor and an old computer case. Once opened, we carefully began to take apart each component, closely examining parts that we usually take for granted.
After the disassembly phase, we checked each internal element one by one to determine which were still functioning and which were no longer usable.

# THE MACHINE PARADOX - SECOND WEEK

During the second week, our task was to create, using the functional devices, a machine whose purpose was useless.

# PERSONAL REFLECTION 

In my life, I had never taken apart an electronic device, so this experience was truly new and surprising for me. It was fascinating to discover how many different components exist inside an old computer: the CD drive, the more hidden internal hardware, the fan, the motherboard, and many other parts we often don’t even realize are there. Testing each component to understand which ones were still working and which ones weren’t felt almost like an investigative process. Each time, I hoped that the pieces we wanted to use for our final idea would still be functional.

The task of building a “useless machine” was a very fun challenge because it forced us to completely flip our way of thinking. Instead of creating something useful, we had to intentionally design something useless — but in a creative and conceptually coherent way. Working in a group, however, wasn’t always easy: finding an idea that everyone genuinely liked required time, discussions, and several compromises. In the end, though, we managed to develop a convincing project that integrated everyone’s perspectives.

Once we defined the concept, dividing the tasks became essential for meeting deadlines and keeping up a good workflow. Personally, I learned a lot about using Arduino and how to properly work with the laser cutter, two tools that initially seemed complex but gradually became more familiar with practice.

The final phase, creating the video, was both fun and very useful: it allowed us to clearly express and present the concept of our machine, giving visual form to all the ideas we had developed.

In conclusion, this experience allowed me to discover a more practical and creative side of working with technology, pushing me out of my comfort zone and helping me learn skills that will certainly be useful in the future.
