# About
I am a Business Administration student with a strong interest in
combining my economic background with the world of design. I
believe that creativity is a powerful tool not only for expression
but also for solving problems and generating innovative ideas.
My academic background has provided me with a solid
foundation in economics and strategic thinking, while my
experiences at CAD and in the Netherlands have enriched and
broadened my knowledge in the field of design.
I enjoy experimenting with new tools and technologies
to explore unconventional solutions and bring ideas to life.
Curious and open-minded, Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to
connect business logic with creative processes, aiming to
contribute to projects where functionality meets imagination.
