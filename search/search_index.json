PRESENTATION TECHSYSTEMS.pdf PERSONAL REFLECTION \u00b6 In my life, I had never taken apart an electronic device, so this experience was truly new and surprising for me. It was fascinating to discover how many different components exist inside an old computer: the CD drive, the more hidden internal hardware, the fan, the motherboard, and many other parts we often don\u2019t even realize are there. Testing each component to understand which ones were still working and which ones weren\u2019t felt almost like an investigative process. Each time, I hoped that the pieces we wanted to use for our final idea would still be functional. The task of building a \u201cuseless machine\u201d was a very fun challenge because it forced us to completely flip our way of thinking. Instead of creating something useful, we had to intentionally design something useless \u2014 but in a creative and conceptually coherent way. Working in a group, however, wasn\u2019t always easy: finding an idea that everyone genuinely liked required time, discussions, and several compromises. In the end, though, we managed to develop a convincing project that integrated everyone\u2019s perspectives. Once we defined the concept, dividing the tasks became essential for meeting deadlines and keeping up a good workflow. Personally, I learned a lot about using Arduino and how to properly work with the laser cutter, two tools that initially seemed complex but gradually became more familiar with practice. The final phase, creating the video, was both fun and very useful: it allowed us to clearly express and present the concept of our machine, giving visual form to all the ideas we had developed. In conclusion, this experience allowed me to discover a more practical and creative side of working with technology, pushing me out of my comfort zone and helping me learn skills that will certainly be useful in the future.

Our first proposal was a Glovo-style delivery box with two compartments: a fake upper compartment that, when opened, revealed a pizza box, and a hidden lower compartment designed to store the spray cans. The idea was that if a police officer stopped the writer and asked to check the box, they would only find a pizza, believe the story, and let the writer go without suspecting that they were doing graffiti. After reflecting on it and discussing it with our professors, we realized that the concept behind the idea was somewhat weak and that the topic of graffiti was not aligned with the projects we were already working on. For this reason, we decided almost immediately to change direction and focus on the theme of flash mobs, which was much more coherent with our overall research path. This shift made me understand how important it is to question initial ideas and evaluate their consistency within a broader conceptual framework. MORAL TRACES \u00b6 During the week, we divided the tasks evenly. We made the main design decisions together. I was primarily responsible for soldering the piezoelectric discs, while Ishan created and 3D-printed a scaled model of the final project. Finally, we assembled and tested the artifact together in preparation for the presentation. The use of AI in this project was almost nonexistent: the calculations regarding the required energy were done manually with Mickel\u2019s help. This made the process more demanding. There were no conflicts or moments of unfairness. The collaboration felt balanced and transparent throughout the process. TECHNICAL / PROCESS TRACES \u00b6 The biggest issue involved the piezoelectric discs. Since they are very fragile, the soldered connections often broke, forcing me to redo them multiple times. This required patience and precision, and it made me more aware of the material limitations we were working with. After completing the final artifact, we decided not to test it again before the final presentation, as we were afraid of damaging it. The most important design decision concerned the shape of the artifact. In the end, we chose a triangular form that could easily interlock with other modular units. This solution proved to be the simplest and most effective choice to ensure modularity and structural stability. In conclusion, the week was very enjoyable and went by quickly. It was particularly useful for me because, after deepening my knowledge of piezoelectric components, I realized that they are not very reliable and are not the solution I was looking for in my personal project.","title":"Cognitive Orgies"},{"location":"term2/Cognitive%20Orgies/#cognitive-traces","text":"Initially, my teammate and I developed an idea to create a box that could quickly hide and transport spray cans for graffiti.

The project is situated within the musical domain. The initial idea involved creating an object that would allow users to improvise using only their fingers, while receiving real-time feedback from an AI agent. However, due to the strict time constraints of the project (two days) and current technological limitations\u2014particularly the response time of AI agents\u2014this approach proved unfeasible. As a result, the concept was simplified while preserving the core idea of musical jamming. In the final version, the user generates a rhythmic pattern through a sequence of touches on a touch sensor; the AI agent analyzes the resulting rhythm and suggests a song with a similar rhythmic structure, providing a YouTube link. The prototype was developed using a Raspberry Pi, a PC with Arduino, a breadboard, and a self-built touch sensor. In the absence of a commercial sensor, a custom touch sensor was constructed using a thin copper sheet, exploiting its electrical conductivity to detect user input. The main challenges emerged during the programming phase and the integration between hardware components and AI agents. Despite encountering several technical challenges and not fully achieving the expected results, the course proved to be a valuable learning experience. Unlike previous courses on artificial intelligence that were more focused on theoretical reflection, this hands-on approach allowed for a clearer understanding of the potential applications of AI within the design process. The most significant aspect was gaining insight into the functioning of AI agents and their integration with physical components such as sensors. This combination highlighted the potential of AI as an active element in the design of interactive systems, opening up new design directions. Overall, the course encouraged a shift in my usual design approach and strengthened my interest in using artificial intelligence as a tool for innovation, an area I intend to explore further.","title":"Extended Intelligences"}]}
