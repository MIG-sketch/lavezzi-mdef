Just another normal day for Erandi. Reflection \u00b6 we participated in three lessons called \u201cLive with Your Own Ideas.\u201d On the first day, we created prosthetics designed to enhance ourselves, exploring how technology and design can improve our abilities. On the second day, we focused on the concept of identity, designing prosthetics that would allow us to become someone else, experimenting with transformation and self-perception. On the third day, we acted as detectives and subjects, testing our ability to analyze and interpret human behavior. During these lessons, we had the opportunity to meet two artists, Manel and Thomas, who have made the motto \u201clive with your own ideas\u201d their way of life. They never let others\u2019 judgments influence them, and listening to their experiences and creative approaches was my favorite part. The lessons were enjoyable but also very challenging: every day we had to create and present our prosthetics to the group. This pressure pushed us to think quickly, find creative solutions, and share our ideas with others. Regarding the detective part, my task was to follow Erandi, but I lost sight of her after a few minutes, which led me to imagine a possible version of her day. I immediately imagined the worst and described her as a monster (I still think she might have killed a little dog). It was this fast-paced environment that made the experience engaging and interesting, teaching us to work quickly without losing originality and to collaborate effectively.","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/Reflections%201%20-%20Living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/#prototypes-to-become-the-best-version-of-yourself","text":"The Thyroid Pill bracelet Prosthesis lets me become my daily cure, a wearable reminder that transforms necessity into expression.

It was fascinating to discover how many different components exist inside an old computer: the CD drive, the more hidden internal hardware, the fan, the motherboard, and many other parts we often don\u2019t even realize are there. Testing each component to understand which ones were still working and which ones weren\u2019t felt almost like an investigative process. Each time, I hoped that the pieces we wanted to use for our final idea would still be functional. The task of building a \u201cuseless machine\u201d was a very fun challenge because it forced us to completely flip our way of thinking. Instead of creating something useful, we had to intentionally design something useless \u2014 but in a creative and conceptually coherent way. Working in a group, however, wasn\u2019t always easy: finding an idea that everyone genuinely liked required time, discussions, and several compromises. In the end, though, we managed to develop a convincing project that integrated everyone\u2019s perspectives. Once we defined the concept, dividing the tasks became essential for meeting deadlines and keeping up a good workflow. Personally, I learned a lot about using Arduino and how to properly work with the laser cutter, two tools that initially seemed complex but gradually became more familiar with practice. The final phase, creating the video, was both fun and very useful: it allowed us to clearly express and present the concept of our machine, giving visual form to all the ideas we had developed. In conclusion, this experience allowed me to discover a more practical and creative side of working with technology, pushing me out of my comfort zone and helping me learn skills that will certainly be useful in the future.","title":"unpacking tech systems & the machine paradox"},{"location":"term1/unpacking%20tech%20systems%20%26%20the%20machine%20paradox/#unpacking-tech-systems","text":"FORENSIC REPORT https://hackmd.io/eOfm3Md3QBONbI2ZetP0xA?view COMPONENT DATA SHEET https://hackmd.io/@Exu-s2ucRkKy-xkK_meJKQ/S1RBwFnlZg","title":"UNPACKING TECH SYSTEMS"},{"location":"term1/unpacking%20tech%20systems%20%26%20the%20machine%20paradox/#the-machine-paradox","text":"","title":"THE MACHINE PARADOX"},{"location":"term1/unpacking%20tech%20systems%20%26%20the%20machine%20paradox/#personal-reflection","text":"In my life, I had never taken apart an electronic device, so this experience was truly new and surprising for me.
