I turned my thyroid pills into a bracelet, so the act of taking care of myself becomes visible, beautiful, and part of my identity. By wearing what usually stays hidden in a drawer, I turn medication into decoration, treatment into culture. It\u2019s a way of reclaiming control, fragility into fashion. The Thyroid Pill Grillz Prosthesis turns a symbol of style and showmanship into something personal and vital. Instead of precious gems, I placed my thyroid pills, what is luxury for others becomes necessity turned into strength for me. It\u2019s a way to make something purely aesthetic become useful, and to give value to what is usually seen as fragility. With these grillz, I can always carry my cure and style with me.

Many people don\u2019t know how to twirl pasta with a fork, and this prototype makes it possible. The fork spins on itself, gathering the spaghetti for the perfect bite, teaching the gesture with precision and style.

She threw it into the plastic recycling bin, it should\u2019ve gone in the organic waste, btw. 12:42 p.m. \u2014 She\u2019s selling cocaine to a pregnant woman. 12:52 p.m. \u2014 She met up with her classmates at a bar, pretending nothing happened, but I know what she did. 12:53 p.m. \u2014 She\u2019s sipping a coffee paid for with drug money. 1:00 p.m. \u2014 She\u2019s back in class.
